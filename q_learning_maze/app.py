"""
Reinforcement learning maze example.

This script is the main part which controls the update method of this example using q-learning algorithm.
The RL algorithm (Q-learning) is in RL_agent.py.
The environment is presented in maze_env.py.

Red rectangle:          explorer.
Black rectangles:       hells       [reward = -1].
Yellow bin circle:      paradise    [reward = +1].
All other states:       ground      [reward = 0].
